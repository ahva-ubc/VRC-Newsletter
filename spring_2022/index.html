<h3>WELCOME</h3>
<p><img src="dependencies/remi_castonguay_headshot.jpg" align="left" style="padding-right:15px;">It has been a busy academic year at AHVA and at the VRC! The VRC presented five interesting workshops/events covering topics as varied as GIS, Digital Exhibits, NFTs and more. Over the last 8 months we also continued to re-organize and renew our space (we now have a Reading Nook, see below!) By weeding through parts of our collections we engaged many students with discarded slides. The VRC has also been busy helping classes with digital exhibit support and with our new Art History Research & Writing Drop-in Clinic. Finally, we are working to improve our social media presence and started publishing a blog. Please read on for more details.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>PixPlot</h3>
<p>We are  testing out a new visualization system for large batches of images, called PixPlot, which utilizes artificial intelligence to analyze, categorize, and display thousands of images in a 2D or 3D space. Come check it out. The animated image above is a recorded example of one implementation. Here is one example, from Yale, of <a href="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/lab-apps/pix-plot/index.html">Image fields in the Meserve-Kunhardt Collection</a>. We hope to use PixPlot to eventually demonstrate a digital form that offers a new interpretation of Aby Warburg’s Bilderatlas Mnemosyne. We continue to explore new digital tools that are useful for both pedagogical and research purposes. Please do come by to discuss your needs, and explore how we can help.

</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<h3>NFT and Blockchain update</h3>
<p>On March 9 we hosted a roundtable discussion on “NFTs, Crypto Art, and Digital Collections?” with Rémi Castonguay, Timothy Fernandes, and AHVA MA Alumna Blake Finucane, and facilitated by Professor Victoria Lemieux (iSchool, UBC). The event was also supported by T'ai Smith who was instrumental in planning it and integrated it to her curriculum. Attended by 80 people on Zoom, the roundtable participants discussed the economic, historical, technological, and preservation aspects of this new art form. The VRC is particularly interested in the process and method of collecting and archiving a medium that is inherently unstable and difficult to contain. We see this process as part of the long-history of the VRC's interest in staying abreast of new technologies and developments in art and media.

</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<h3>Slide deaccessioning continues</h3>
<p>Deaccessioning of slides is ongoing. Thirty or so students have visited to pick up slides—some take a few, others take dozens. It is a slow process but has been a good point of contact to interact with students and introduce them to the VRC. As we continue weeding through the collection we hope to engage faculty and students to integrate our collections to the curriculum.

				<h3>spaces and services survey results</h3>
			<p>The VRC Spaces and Services Survey has closed. We received 47 responses—thank you!—and we are now processing the results. More to come shortly. So far we have held three focus groups regarding the space with faculty, graduate and undergraduate students.
			</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<h3>reading nook</h3>
					<p>As part of the ongoing decluttering and slide deaccessioning process we have cleared away a small corner that is now a nook for reading and research. Open to all. It is also a good spot for office hours.</p>

	<h3>Art History Research and Writing Drop-in Clinic</h3>
<p>The writing clinic for undergraduates has finished for the term. We will resume the clinic in the fall with set regular hours.

</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>gis workshop and tools</h3>
<p>On March 18 we held a workshop on GIS (Geographic Information Systems) with Jeff O’Brien and UBC GIS Librarian Evan Thornberry, which looked at the uses of GIS technology in art historical practices and research. We are currently using CollectionBuilder for several projects, including Joseph Monteyne's <a href="https://ahva-ubc.github.io/early-modern-italy/">ARTH 322 class</a>, and have assisted several builds of the software for undergraduate and graduate student projects.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;

</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>spring departures</h3>
<p>We want to note that this term is Alexi Paglinawan’s last term as a work-learn student in the VRC as she is focusing on finishing her MA thesis. Thank you, Alexi, and best wishes for your next adventures!
